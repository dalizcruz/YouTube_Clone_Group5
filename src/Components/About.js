            Building a new career around my new found passion is such a
            blessing! As a web developer, I love being able to wake up and
            create problems, find solutions, and ultimately produce quality
            work. Programming is for everyone! I am currently learning through
            the amazing people at Pursuit - a year long, competitive
            project-based software development fellowship. Each day I am pushing
            myself to get further and more creative with the knowledge that I
            hold.

            I am a solutions-oriented full stack web developer, passionate about
            building products that solve real-world problems. My background in
            customer service has given me strong communication skills and a
            penchant for helping people, and has shown me firsthand the
            importance of creating platforms and systems that take into account
            customer needs. My projects pull from best practices in UI/UX and
            accessibility research to keep the user front and center and enable
            easy navigation. I thrive in work environments that have clear
            processes and where employees take ownership and pride in their
            work. Born in the Dominican Republic and raised in NYC, and having
            spent 4 years in local government, I am particularly interested in
            projects that aim to improve city services or public education for
            New Yorkers.
